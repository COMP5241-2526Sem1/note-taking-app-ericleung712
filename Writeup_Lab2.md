- ** Lesson learn in AI generate note
- ** ðŸ”§1. Display of the event date & time.  After i ask the AI to show the generated note in the same style as the note list.
- **    The background green color is much wider than the nubmers and it reach the margin of the box.  I tried to fix myself by 
- **    modifying the it's class width but it did not help.  After asking AI, it figure out that my event date time was write under

- ** ðŸ”§2. Accurracy of generated note.  Before introducing the prompt the generated note always miss the event date and time or give wrong date.
- **      After giving an clear instruction and a template of result in .json format.  The function is more reliable.  I further stated today is today 
- **      so that AI can calculate a correct date when user input tomorrow, next monday, etc.

- **      The connection with the database cannot be establish.  After asking AI, I learnt that this symbol
